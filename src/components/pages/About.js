          The Creator of ANON A scientist and teacher from Poland A lot of
          people doesn’t know or understand that animals are similar to us –
          they are more inteligent, full of emotions and fragile than we
          expected, which show a many of research. That is why we should protect
          them as we protect ourselves. We can do that only by educate the
          people, raising the level of awareness about how much they suffer,
          because we don’t care enough and finally – change the law. Edith ANON
