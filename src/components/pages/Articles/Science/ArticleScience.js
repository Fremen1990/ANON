                        The valuable properties of deer antlers have been known and
                        used in alternative medicine for a long time (in Chinese
                        medicine, the territory of New Zealand and South America). The
                        powdered deer antlers were and are primarily used to
                        accelerate the healing of wounds and fractures, strengthen the
                        body and in the fight against diseases such as osteoporosis,
                        iron deficiency (anaemia), arterial-hypertension or AD, known
                        as atopic dermatitis. The ordinary "stagers" also use them to
                        make tinctures for which recipes can be easily found on the
                        Internet.

                        For several years, research on the properties and
                        possibilities of using deer antlers has also been carried out
                        in the field of convection medicine. The history of these
                        studies begins in Poland, specifically at Wroclaw Medical
                        University. In 2003, employees of this institution visited The
                        Wroclaw Zoological Garden because a fawn damaged his antlers,
                        which were still growing (Cervus elaphus / the red deer). The
                        effect of this intervention, apart from helping the animal,
                        was the removal of tissue fragments from the damaged antlers.
                        The activity of Stem Cells Spin S.A. (JSC) mainly relies on
                        the breeding of MIC-1 and its derivative substances, as well
                        as the development and sale of products derived from them.

                        within various research projects. These projects concern the
                        creation of substances and preparations used in medicine for

                        projects aimed at the development of cosmetology. It is mainly
                        about dermocosmetics. For this purpose, Stem Cells Spin S.A
                        has created the Revitacell brand.

                        <strong>Revitacell</strong> has in its offer sets and
                        cosmetics intended for face or eye care. Those are mainly
                        various types of creams, serums or concentrates based on MIC-1
                        stem cells and derivatives. Manufacturers report that the most
                        important goal of their cosmetics is to mitigate the effects
                        of tissue aging by supporting its regeneration processes after
                        damage caused by biological or external (e.g. environmental
                        conditions) factors. The prices of these cosmetics are
                        classified as above average which results from the expensive
                        technological process leading to their production. The sets
                        range from 200 to 300 PLN, creams from 100 to 200 PLN and eye
                        and hair concentrates (e.g. eyelashes) from 70 up to 190PLN.
                        Researchers from the University of Wroclaw isolated the stem
                        cells from the collected tissue and began to multiply them.
                        Soon after, it got to the groundbreaking discovery! The stem
                        cells, obtained from red deer antlers, were named Mic-1 (after
                        the names of the researchers and the only woman in the team)
                        and the results of research have been published, indicating
                        their amazing potential. In one of the articles on this
                        subject, we read that Mic-1 multiplies very intensively (the
                        growth of antlers is 1-2 cm per day, which indicates an
                        increased rate of cell division). For this reason, they show
                        great regenerative abilities enabling effective tissue
                        renewal. Due to the fact that MIC-1 are of animal origin, they
                        also have many similarities to the cells produced by the bone
                        marrow of other animals and humans. The application of MIC-1
                        in the treatment of diseases and cosmetology is therefore
                        safe, because these cells do not trigger an immune response
                        (e.g. they do not cause an allergic reaction). The research
                        team from the University of Wroclaw also conducted tests aimed
                        at confirming the efficiency of MIC-1 in the treatment of
                        diseases. For example, they conducted in vitro studies on
                        keratinocytes and fibroblasts. The studies have shown that
                        MIC-1 stimulate their renewal, which improves the elasticity
                        of connective tissue and skin. This discovery led to the start
                        of work on production of dermocosmetics based on MIC-1.

                        Due to the difficulties in obtaining funds for further

                        share capital in the amount of 50,000PLN. Over time, the
                        company became Stem Cells Spin S.A (JSC) and its share capital
                        increased to 1,293,650PLN in 2014.

                    <p className="text-justify mt-2 lh-base">
                        Due to the fact that dermocosmetics ,offered by Revitacell ,
                        are of animal origin, not everyone will be interested in them(
                        mainly people declaring themselves as vegans or activists,
                        fighting against cosmetics testing on animals). ANON, as the
                        international organization, is not critical of the
                        establishment and development of Stem Cells S.A.
                        ( the founder of ANON is a molecular biologist, what allows
                        her for evaluation). However, we are concerned about the fact
                        that MIC-1 are obtained from red deer antlers and we do not
                        know where these antlers come from (rather they are not
                        collected in forest), under what conditions the animals live
                        and if the procedure for collecting antler fragments is safe
                        and painless? We have no information on what it looks like.
                        There is also the issue of testing the Revitacell products on
                        animals. We know, after consulting with the founder of ANON,
                        that in the case of many substances, drugs or cosmetics, there
                        is no non â€“invasive, available way of testing them other than
                        on animals. And that is the case with Revitacell
                        dermocosmetics.

                            suffer because of the foreseen or not side effects.
